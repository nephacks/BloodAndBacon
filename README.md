# BloodAndBacon
Decompile of Blood and Bacon, a gorey XNA game



# Building

build tested on vs 2022 idk what to tell you

install XNA game studio, which by extension requires a variant of vs 2010 (vs 2010 c# express should work)

copy SkinnedModel.dll and Steamworks.NET.dll from your game into the lib folder

open sln in vs 2022 and build debug/release|x86

you require the game files still
